## Advanced JS: Homework 0

**Estimated time: 30 mins. No submissions.**

First things first: get your computer and life set up.

- Install Google Chrome
- Install [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- Create an account on [Github](github.com)
- Sign in, and watch this repo by clicking the "Watch" button at top-right
- [Optional] Create an account on [Heroku](heroku.com)
- [Optional] Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)

Then, please (re)familiarize yourself with the things below. For those with
less coding experience, try your best to understand as much as possible! 

- A [Javascript primer on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript). It's not necessary that you do any or all of the modules, but please be familiar with variables, the `var` keyword, `for`, `while`, `if`, arrays and calling/creating functions. Note how it is both similar and different from C/Java.
  - Bonus: know about Javascript objects.
- Take an amble through [The Javascript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/). This will be one of the best resources available to you. Again, no need to understand it all, but know some basic things:
  - Do you have to declare variable types in JS?
  - Is Javascript object-oriented?
  - What's the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
- Read [this blog post](http://recurial.com/programming/understanding-callback-functions-in-javascript) about callback functions (which are pretty func-y!). Not necessary to grasp everything, but familiarize yourself with the topics and lingoâ€”it'll make covering it in class much easier.
